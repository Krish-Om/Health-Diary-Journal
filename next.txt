**Project Title:** HealthDiary - Personal Health Journal

**Objective:** Develop a full-stack webpage that serves as a personal health journal for users to manage their health information securely and efficiently.

### Features and Requirements:

1. **User Authentication and Security:**
   - Implement secure user authentication with email verification and password recovery.
   - Ensure data encryption and follow best practices for data privacy and security.

2. **Personal Information Management:**
   - Create a user profile section to input and display personal information, including:
     - Full name
     - Birth date
     - Contact information (phone number, email address)
   - Allow users to update their personal details.

3. **Medical History Tracker:**
   - Develop a section for users to document their medical history, including:
     - Past diagnoses (e.g., asthma, diabetes)
     - Details of surgeries (e.g., date, type of surgery, and outcomes)
     - Reasons for past hospitalizations
   - Include options to upload related documents or images for reference.

4. **Medication List and Adherence Monitoring:**
   - Design a feature for users to maintain a comprehensive list of medications:
     - Name of the medication
     - Dosage information
     - Frequency of intake (e.g., once a day, twice a day)
   - Provide an interface for daily adherence tracking with reminders and alerts for missed doses.
   - Allow users to log notes about side effects or any changes in medication.

5. **Test Results Repository:**
   - Implement a section for users to store and view their test results:
     - Include support for various types of test results (e.g., blood work, imaging studies).
     - Allow users to upload and categorize test results by date and type.
     - Provide visual aids (graphs, charts) for tracking changes in test results over time.

6. **Journal Entries and Progress Updates:**
   - Develop a journaling feature where users can write and save daily or weekly health updates.
   - Include the ability to add tags to entries (e.g., "symptoms," "exercise," "diet").
   - Enable users to attach multimedia (photos, voice notes) to their entries.
   - Provide analytics to visualize progress over time (e.g., symptom trends, weight changes).

7. **User Interface and Experience:**
   - Design a user-friendly and responsive interface that is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
   - Ensure intuitive navigation with clearly labeled sections and easy access to all features.

8. **Backend and Database Requirements:**
   - Use a robust backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django) to handle data processing and user management.
   - Implement a secure and scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user data.
   - Ensure regular backups and data integrity checks.

9. **Deployment and Maintenance:**
   - Deploy the webpage on a reliable hosting platform with SSL certification.
   - Set up a monitoring system to track usage and identify potential issues.
   - Provide regular updates and maintenance to keep the system secure and up-to-date.

### Technologies to Consider:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Vue.js, or Angular for dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, Django, or Flask for server-side logic.
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL) or PostgreSQL (SQL) for structured and unstructured data.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2 for secure user authentication.
- **Hosting:** AWS, Azure, or Heroku for deployment and scalability.
- **Storage:** AWS S3 or similar services for storing user-uploaded documents and images.

### Project Timeline and Milestones:

1. **Week 1-2:** Initial setup, user authentication, and personal information management.
2. **Week 3-4:** Develop medical history tracker and medication list features.
3. **Week 5-6:** Implement test results repository and journaling features.
4. **Week 7:** Finalize UI/UX design and conduct thorough testing.
5. **Week 8:** Deploy the application and set up monitoring and maintenance.
